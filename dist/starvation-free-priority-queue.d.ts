/**
 * StarvationFreePriorityQueue
 *
 * The `StarvationFreePriorityQueue` class implements an in-memory priority queue designed to mitigate
 * the issue of starvationâ€”where low-priority items may never be processed due to the continuous arrival
 * of higher-priority items. It achieves this by balancing two key factors:
 * - **Priority**: Represented by a numeric value.
 * - **Arrival time**: Ensures fairness for items that have waited longer.
 *
 * This balanced approach makes the implementation ideal for task scheduling where fairness is critical,
 * though it may not be suitable for greedy algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm.
 *
 * ### Algorithm
 * The balance between priority and arrival time is achieved through the following data structures:
 * - **FIFO Queue**: Holds all pending items in their order of arrival.
 * - **Priority Frontier**: A sorted array representing the **next batch** of items ready for removal,
 *   prioritized by their numeric priority value.
 *
 * **Push and Pop Operations**:
 * - **Pushing Items**: New items are added to the FIFO Queue.
 * - **Popping Items**:
 *   - If the Priority Frontier contains items, the top (highest-priority) item is removed and returned,
 *     prioritizing the priority attribute greedily within each batch.
 *   - If the Priority Frontier is empty, up to `_maxDeferment + 1` items are pulled from the FIFO Queue,
 *     sorted by priority, and moved to the Priority Frontier for removal. This ensures fairness by
 *     accounting for the order of arrival.
 *
 * ### Starvation Coefficient - Maximum Deferment
 * Low-priority items can be delayed by **at most** `maxDeferment` pop attempts, as defined by the user.
 * This ensures fairness while maintaining the priority order, provided that `maxDeferment` is not exceeded.
 *
 * ### Complexity
 * - **Push**: O(1).
 * - **Pop**:
 *   - **Amortized**: O(log(maxDeferment)).
 *   - **Best case**: O(1).
 *   - **Worst case**: O(maxDeferment * log(maxDeferment)) when a new frontier is populated.
 *
 * ### Example Use Cases
 * - Task scheduling where fairness is critical but priority remains significant.
 * - Resource allocation systems requiring bounded delays for low-priority tasks.

     * @param maxDeferment The maximum number of 'pop' operations a low-priority item
     *                      can be delayed by higher-priority items within the same batch.
     * @param getPriority A callback function to extract the priority of an item.
     *                     Larger numeric values indicate higher priority.
     * @param estimatedMaxCapacity An estimate of the queue's maximum capacity, representing
     *                             the expected backpressure of items waiting to be removed
     *                             by the 'pop' operation. This serves as an optimization
     *                             parameter, as higher estimates reduce the frequency of
