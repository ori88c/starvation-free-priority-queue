  "description": "An in-memory priority queue that prevents starvation by balancing priority and arrival time. Items are greedily prioritized within each batch of the longest-waiting items, ensuring fairness alongside prioritization and bounded delays for low-priority tasks. This makes it ideal for scenarios such as task scheduling in CI/CD pipelines, resource allocation in distributed systems, and managing customer support ticket queues to ensure timely resolution for all priorities, among other use cases.",
